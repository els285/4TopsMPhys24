# 4Tops MPhys 2024
Repository for Manchester MPhys project "Top Quark to the 4"

# Summary
We will be studying rare "multitop" processes, focusing primarily on "4tops": production of the four top quarks at the LHC. 
We will also consider how to apply techniques we develop in the 4tops channel to "3tops".


# Tasks
I will update the major tasks in the Tasks section of this git.

# Datasets
I will include all datasets [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p-p9qpwUMAE0v-bAe_b3tJDzZxShlq0n?usp=sharing)

# Intended Research Outcomes
## Initial
* How to separate 3tops and 4tops signals from one another using discriminative kinematic distributions
* Can/do we need to separate these processes from one another using MVA techniques?
* Applying and extending kinematic reconstruction techniques to these processes

## Extensions
* Developing the kinematic reconstruction techniques
* Studying these processes in an EFT context
