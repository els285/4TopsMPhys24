**Weekly Meetings Wednesdays at 10am**

# Summary
We will be studying rare "multitop" processes, focusing primarily on "4tops": production of the four top quarks at the LHC. 
We will also consider how to apply techniques we develop in the 4tops channel to "3tops".

This is intended to be a collaborative project with input from yourselves!

# Physics Resources
I wrote a quick physics primer for summer students which might still be useful, found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/byxhgqjmqjkw#9112d0).

A top physics summary [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/447/1/012012/pdf](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/447/1/012012/pdf). There are plenty others at various levels of complexity.


# Tasks
I will update the major tasks in the Tasks section of this git.

# Datasets
I will include all datasets [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p-p9qpwUMAE0v-bAe_b3tJDzZxShlq0n?usp=sharing)

# Intended Research Outcomes
## Initial
* How to separate 3tops and 4tops signals from one another using discriminative kinematic distributions
* Can/do we need to separate these processes from one another using MVA techniques?
* Applying and extending kinematic reconstruction techniques to these processes

## Extensions
* Developing the kinematic reconstruction techniques
* Studying these processes in an EFT context

# Intended Student Outcomes
* Exposure to high-energy physics research
* Experience using Scikit-HEP tools for HEP data analysis.
* Develop Python skills
* Develop machine learning experience in Python
* Whatever else you would like that fits within the scope of this project!
