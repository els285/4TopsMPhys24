# Technical Prerequisites
Here is where I'll put any technical information we will need.

## Analysis on own laptop
More complex MVA training will require use of GPU batch systems, however for other analysis we can make use of your own laptops to begin with.

### Notebook Setups
Either of these provide a Python notebook in which you can install relevant Python modules.

#### VSCode notebooks: 
VSCode installation [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Notebooks in VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

#### Google Colab notebooks

### Terminal
We can probably use Windows Subsystem for Linux.

## Grid Usage
We will set you up on lxplus and on Manchester CSF cluster.
