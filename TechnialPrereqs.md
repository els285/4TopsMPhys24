# Technical Prerequisites
Here is where I'll put any technical information we will need.

## Analysis on own laptop
More complex MVA training will require use of GPU batch systems, however for other analysis we can make use of your own laptops to begin with.

### Notebook Setups
* VSCode notebooks: VSCode installation [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
* Google Colab notebooks: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
Either of these provide a Python notebook in which you can install relevant Python modules.

### Terminal
We can probably use Windows Subsystem for Linux.

## Grid Usage
We will set you up on lxplus and on Manchester CSF cluster.
