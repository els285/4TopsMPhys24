# Semester 2 Start

## DNN Work 
* Make DNN into a Python script which can be run in the terminal as:
```bash
python run_DNN.py --train_file=train_file.h5 --test_file=tset_file.h5
```
* Plot the loss curves for training

  ## Running HyPER
  We will focus on the 0L channel to start.
  1. Install HyPER: Use [Simon's tutorial on running HyPER on Chicago](https://github.com/els285/4TopsMPhys24/blob/main/Tasks/Semester2/HyPERonChicago.md) to get set up:
     Conda is a package manager which allows us to install all the necessary PyTorch-associated tools for grpah neural networks.
      * Install `conda` (via miniforge)
      * Build the conda environment
  
  * Build a .h5 4tops 0L
