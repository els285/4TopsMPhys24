# High-Level Studies 

Can we discriminate between 3tops and 4tops by looking at partonic information? Build a neural network to do this.

What does this look like when we use perfectly-matched reco-level kinematics to reconstruct the tops?
**Outcome:** How does "reconstructed" resonance DNN compare to a final-state DNN? How does a combination of such perform?

How well can we reconstruct the top quarks?
**Outcome** Can we reconstruct the tops at all in four-tops using HyPER? In which channels?

Ultimately, can we use HyPER to reconstruct tops and thus improve signal-background discrimination over an equivalent low-level DNN?
