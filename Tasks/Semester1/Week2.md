# 3tops vs 4tops Week 2

Using the files found in the `RecoLevel` directory of the Google Drive.
These are "reco-level" simulations i.e. they are simulations of what would be observed in the ATLAS detector; 
as such they don't contain the "partonic" top quarks, instead final-state jets and leptons.

## Truth Task
1. Look at delta eta and delta phi as per Yvonne's instruction

## Tasks
1. Find distributions which show differences between 3tops and 4tops.
2. Look at the HEP Software Foundation DNN tutorial:
   [https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-ml-webpage/](ttps://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-ml-webpage/).
   If you can't get the CSV files for this, I have them in `DNN_Tutorial` part of Google Drive.
3. Build a DNN to discriminate between 3tops and 4tops - if we think it is needed...
