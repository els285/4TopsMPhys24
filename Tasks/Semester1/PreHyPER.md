# Preparing for HyPER

There are several things we need to set up:
* A terminal (see below)
* An account on CSF (Ethan setting these up)
* `Conda` environment installed on CSF
* `HyPERMancs` cloned: link

## Terminal
The native Mac terminal is fine to use (however there are other alternatives)
For Windows one can use Windows Subsystem for Linux [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
Or you can probably just use the terminal inside VSCode.

Then one needs to learn how to navigate around using the Terminal, and running Python scripts. 
[This link](https://github.com/els285/SummerProjects24/blob/main/TechnicalPrereqs.md) provides some additional content and links to resources.

Good to get comfortable with this.

## CSF
The CSF documentaton [here](https://ri.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/csf3/) is pretty good.
I have some notes about CSF in that link above. It's a computing facility that we "ssh" into, so that you're no longer working on your own computer, but on these UoM computer notes.
To ssh, I do
```bash
<username>@csf3.itservices.manchester.ac.uk
```
then put in my password, then I have to two-factor authenticate using the Duo app on my phone.

## Conda 
Download and install [MiniForge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge). Or alternative...
