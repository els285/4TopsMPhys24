# Preparing for HyPER

There are several things we need to set up:
* A terminal (see below)
* An account on CSF (Ethan setting these up)
* `Conda` environment installed on CSF
* `HyPERMancs` cloned: link

## Terminal
The native Mac terminal is fine to use (however there are other alternatives)
For Windows one can use Windows Subsystem for Linux [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
Or you can probably just use the terminal inside VSCode.

Then one needs to learn how to navigate around using the Terminal, and running Python scripts.
